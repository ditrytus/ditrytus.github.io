## Unity

Recently I started learning Unity. [Unity](https://unity3d.com) is game engine that can be used free of charge, is very simple to learn and comes with it's own IDE. To me a software is as good as a documentation it comes with, and Unity comes with a a very good and comprehensive reference. You can find [good tutorials](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials) on the official website that will walk you through all the important.

I was doing a [Space Shooter](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial) tutorial form the official website when I quickly noticed, that scripting part of the lessons are aimed for the people who don't have experience with programming and/or C# (which is a language supported by Unity). In my opinion scripts presented in the tutorial combine too many responsibilities and are not clear to read and undestand. Of course when you are following the tutorial and are guided by the tutor through the creation of every line, they seem obvious but I felt that it can be done bettter.

## Reactive Extensions for Unity

Another thing I was recently exploring is [reactive programming](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754) through a library that supports that programming model [Reactive Extensions](http://reactivex.io). In essence, Reactive Extensions allows you to
model your program's behaviour as a combination of time dependent streams of values. Every input to your program, IO, events and passage of time, can be modeled as streams of values. Reactive Extensions allow you to transform and subscribe to these streams in a declarative way which result in a much cleaner and readable code especially when you are dealing with parallel or time dependent logic. Games logic tend to be very time dependent, you constantly have to handle all sorts of events like collisions, game state changes and user input.

Reactive Extensions supports many languages and comes in a lot of flavours and yes, there is a version for Unity too which is called UniRx. You can find [UniRx on github](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx) or in a [Unity's Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/17276).

In this post I will compare the original tutorial scripts with my versions written in UniRx. Two things to note though:
1. I am a beginner when it comes to Reactive Extensions, and I stumbled upon a few problems which I resolved in my own way. If any of you have a better idea how to approach certain things, or if you'll see that I am completely butchering the idea, please let me know.
2. I decided to rewrite every script with UniRx and in a few of them there is a little or no gain in readability or length of the script.
3. I assume you did the Space Shooter tutorial yourself or that you are experienced enough to understand simple Unity C# sciprts.

## PlayerController

First lets look at tutorial's original `PlayerController.cs`. This script is attached to a player GameObject and contains *all* the behaviours of player's ship.

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
  public float speed;
  public float tilt;
  public Boundary boundary;

  public GameObject shot;
  public Transform shotSpawn;
  public float fireRate;
     
  private float nextFire;
    
  void Update ()
  {
    if (Input.GetButton("Fire1") && Time.time > nextFire) 
    {
      nextFire = Time.time + fireRate;
      Instantiate(shot, shotSpawn.position, shotSpawn.rotation);
      GetComponent<AudioSource>().Play ();
    }
  }

  void FixedUpdate ()
  {
    float moveHorizontal = Input.GetAxis ("Horizontal");
    float moveVertical = Input.GetAxis ("Vertical");

    Vector3 movement =
      new Vector3 (moveHorizontal, 0.0f, moveVertical);
    GetComponent<Rigidbody>().velocity = movement * speed;
    
    GetComponent<Rigidbody>().position = new Vector3
    (
      Mathf.Clamp(
        GetComponent<Rigidbody>().position.x,
        boundary.xMin,
        boundary.xMax), 
      0.0f, 
      Mathf.Clamp(
        GetComponent<Rigidbody>().position.z,
        boundary.zMin,
        boundary.zMax)
    );
    
    GetComponent<Rigidbody>().rotation =
      Quaternion.Euler (
        0.0f,
        0.0f,
        GetComponent<Rigidbody>().velocity.x * -tilt);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

`PlayerController` does the following things:

1. When `Fire1` button is pressed then player's ship shoots, with a rate not faster then `fireRate` shots per second, playing a sound.
2. When direction buttons are pressed pleyer's ship moves in that direction.
3. Player's position is clamped to a certain boundary.
4. Player's ship tilts left and right proportionally to the velocity in a given direction.

One thing that I like about Unity is that it's scripting API allows to have so many different behaviours with a few lines of code. What I don't like however is that because of that simplicity it encourages to pack a lot of unrelated things in one script. So I split all the distinctive behaviours into separate scripts.

### TiltOnMove

First I extracted tilting behaviour to `TiltOnMove.cs`:

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
public class TiltOnMove : RxBehaviour
{
  public float tilt;

  void Start ()
  {
    var sub1 = Observable.EveryFixedUpdate()
      .Subscribe(_ =>
      {
        GetComponent<Rigidbody>().rotation =
          Quaternion.Euler(
            0.0f,
            0.0f,
            GetComponent<Rigidbody>().velocity.x * -tilt);
      });

    AddSubscriptions(sub1);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The new script has only one parameter `tilt` and does only one thing: tilts object on z axis based on x axis velocity. Advantages are that if any other object in the gama should have been tilted in the same way, you only need to attach this script and viola!

As you can see instead of using `void FixedUpdate ()` method, I am subscribing to `Observable.EveryFixedUpdate()` observable. The resulting code seems to have more UniRx clutter then necessary and here is where I would consider not using UniRx at all costs. New base class `RxBehaviour`  and `AddSubscriptions(sub1);` instruction I will explain later on.

### MoveOnInput

Next extracted class is `MoveOnInput.cs`:

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
public class MoveOnInput : RxBehaviour
{
  public float speed;
  
  void Start ()
  {
    var sub1 = Observable.EveryFixedUpdate()
      .Subscribe(_ =>
      {
        GetComponent<Rigidbody>().velocity =
          new Vector3(
            Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"),
            0.0f,
            Input.GetAxis("Vertical"))
          * speed;
      });

    AddSubscriptions(sub1);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The sole responsibility of this script is to set objects velocity proportionally to user input and some `speed` factor. By inlining a few local variables: `float moveHorizontal`, `float moveVertical` and `Vector3 movement`, the whole thing could have been compacted into one, still readable instruction.

Like the previous one, this script does not yet benefit from the usage of UniRx but it's single purpose whould allow to attach it to any object that's movement needs to be controled by user input.

Now that we can move objects, we should also be able to bind that movement:

### BoundMovement

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
public class BoundMovement : RxBehaviour
{
  public Boundary boundary;

  void Start ()
  {
    var sub1 = Observable.EveryFixedUpdate()
      .Subscribe(_ =>
      {
        transform.position = new Vector3(
          Mathf.Clamp(
            transform.position.x,
            boundary.xRange.min,
            boundary.xRange.max),
          Mathf.Clamp(
            transform.position.y,
            boundary.yRange.min,
            boundary.yRange.max),
          Mathf.Clamp(
            transform.position.z,
            boundary.zRange.min,
            boundary.zRange.max)
        );
      });
    
    AddSubscriptions(sub1);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Single reposnsibility of that class is to limit the movement of any object to a certain boundary. Same thing can be achieved with properly set colliders but for simple games doing it manually without the aid of the physics engine is enough. Again, with that script extracted we can limit the movement of any object.

You probably noticed that I am clamping all 3 axes instead of just `x` and `z`; and that `boundary.xMin` changed into `boundary.xRange.min`. That's because I also refactored `Boundary` class. The original was:

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
public class Boundary 
{
  public float xMin, xMax, zMin, zMax;
}
{% endhighlight %}

It has two sets of similar variables `*Min` and `*Max`. If you wan't would want to have a support for y axis you would get third pair of those. Such repetition screams for introducing a separate structure for that. Since `Min` and `Max` defines a range of `float` vlaues so we can introduce:

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
public class FloatRange {
  public float min;
  public float max;
}
{% endhighlight %}

and we can refactor our `Boundary` class to:

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
public class Boundary
{
  public FloatRange xRange;
  public FloatRange yRange;
  public FloatRange zRange;
}
{% endhighlight %}

In addition we such structure looks nicer when serialized in the editor:

![Boundary class in editor]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/boundary_editor.png)

### SpawnOnFire

So far we haven't seen any advantages of using UniRx alone, but the next script shows in what situations it shines. On button press `SpawnOnFire` scirpt instantiates a shot game object in a certain position limiting it to a certain rate.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
public class SpawnOnFire : RxBehaviour
{
  public GameObject spawnedObject;

  public Transform spawnPoint;

  public float throttle;

  public string buttonName;

  void Start () {
    var sub1 = Observable.EveryUpdate()
      .Where(_ => Input.GetButton(buttonName))
      .ThrottleFirst(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(throttle))
      .Subscribe(_ => {
        Instantiate(
          spawnedObject,
          spawnPoint.position,
          spawnPoint.rotation);
        GetComponent<AudioSource>().Play();
      });
    
    AddSubscriptions(sub1);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's look closer into what's going on in a separate lines:

12. `Observable.EveryUpdate()` - we are taking a stream of all game updates;
13. `.Where(_ => Input.GetButton(buttonName))` - we are filtering that stream to only those updates when a certain button is pressed;
14. `.ThrottleFirst(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(throttle))` - `Throttle` filter a stream further in such a way that subsequent signals have to occure at least certain `TimeSpan` apart. Variant `ThrottleFirst` lets through the first element in the stream.
15. `.Subscribe(...)` - we are doing our shot instantiation and playing sound. 

To me this code is much more expressive than the original impementation that used a private field `float nextFire` to hold calculated time of when the next shot is allowed.

## DestroyOnTimeout

Original `DestroyByTime` script is used to automatically clear the scene from explotion particle systems. The original code looks like this:

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
public class DestroyByTime : MonoBehaviour
{
  public float lifetime;

  void Start ()
  {
    Destroy (gameObject, lifetime);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The version of that script written with UniRx:

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
public class DestroyOnTimeout : RxBehaviour
{
  public float timeout;

  void Start () {
    var sub1 = Observable
      .Timer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(timeout))
      .Subscribe(_ => {
        Destroy(gameObject);
      });
    
    AddSubscriptions(sub1);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Original version is much shorted but again it's hard to figure out whats going on in `Destroy (gameObject, lifetime);` without going to [`Object.Destroy documentation`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Destroy.html). In contrast, in UniRx code even though a bit longer we see straight that a timer is being set to a certain amount of seconds, and that we want to destroy an object when that timer fires. 

## GameController

Let's look first at an original code of `GameController` class:

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
public class Done_GameController : MonoBehaviour
{
  public GameObject[] hazards;
  public Vector3 spawnValues;
  public int hazardCount;
  public float spawnWait;
  public float startWait;
  public float waveWait;
  
  public GUIText scoreText;
  public GUIText restartText;
  public GUIText gameOverText;
  
  private bool gameOver;
  private bool restart;
  private int score;
  
  void Start ()
  {
    gameOver = false;
    restart = false;
    restartText.text = "";
    gameOverText.text = "";
    score = 0;
    UpdateScore ();
    StartCoroutine (SpawnWaves ());
  }
  
  void Update ()
  {
    if (restart)
    {
      if (Input.GetKeyDown (KeyCode.R))
      {
        SceneManager.LoadScene(
          SceneManager.GetActiveScene().buildIndex);
      }
    }
  }
  
  IEnumerator SpawnWaves ()
  {
    yield return new WaitForSeconds (startWait);
    while (true)
    {
      for (int i = 0; i < hazardCount; i++)
      {
        GameObject hazard =
          hazards [Random.Range (0, hazards.Length)];
        Vector3 spawnPosition = new Vector3 (
          Random.Range (-spawnValues.x, spawnValues.x),
          spawnValues.y,
          spawnValues.z);
        Quaternion spawnRotation = Quaternion.identity;
        Instantiate (hazard, spawnPosition, spawnRotation);
        yield return new WaitForSeconds (spawnWait);
      }
      yield return new WaitForSeconds (waveWait);
      
      if (gameOver)
      {
        restartText.text = "Press 'R' for Restart";
        restart = true;
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  
  public void AddScore (int newScoreValue)
  {
    score += newScoreValue;
    UpdateScore ();
  }
  
  void UpdateScore ()
  {
    scoreText.text = "Score: " + score;
  }
  
  public void GameOver ()
  {
    gameOverText.text = "Game Over!";
    gameOver = true;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now boy oh boy we have a lot of stuff going on here. I don't know even where to start:



## Naming scripts

In general you should name a class using a noun expression. Classes define objects which should be thought of as "things", so noun seems natural here. However many Unity scripts are components attached to game objects that define a certain behaviours of that object and how it interacts with other objects. In fact, all scripts inherit from `MonoBehaviour` class. My preference is to use verb expressions to name behaviours rather than nouns. The original tutorial scripts names are not consistent here.

A certain behaviour is usually triggered by certain events. Common naming convention for event handlers is `On(EventName)` and that's how I decided to rename certain scripts.

I also prefer to use an actual event names as they appear in the scriptin API, for example `Collision` instead of `Contact`, or `TriggerExit` instead of `Boundary`.

Here are the scripts renamed according to the above rules:

| *Original name* | *New name* |
| `DystroyByBoundary` | `DestroyOnTriggerExit` |
| `DestroyByContact` | `DestroyOnCollision` |
| `DestroyByTime` | `DesrtroyOnTimeout` |
| `Mover` | `MoveForward` |
| `RandomRotator` | `RotateRandomly`|
