Most of video games require an ability to suspend action. There can be number of reasons to do so:
* we want to give player an access to set of menus like: game options, save, load etc.;
* game play itself might require opening full screen menus like maps, journals or inventory while allowing player not to worry on what is going on on the main scene;
* or just to give a player an ability to take a rest without sacrificing victory.
